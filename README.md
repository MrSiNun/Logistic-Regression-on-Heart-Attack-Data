Logistic Regression on Heart Attack Data
----------------

This project involves using R to examine a dataset containing information about heart attack cases.  In my analysis, I generated a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of a patient dying from a heart attack.  I compared this model with a Na√Øve Bayes classification model to see which model is more accurate.  The goal is to maximize the accuracy of my final model recommendation to ensure effective classification of heart attack cases.

The full report can be found in the file "Logistic Regression.pdf".  This report shows a complete breakdown of my analysis, including problem identification, motivation, data exploration, data preparation, data partition, predictive modeling, model results, model tuning, and proposed solutions.  Tables, visualizations, and a copy of my code are included in the appendices.

The dataset "whas500.csv" was provided by my course instructor at the University of Maryland University College.  The original data source and variable description were from Hosmer, Lemeshow, and May (2008).

The R script is included in the file "regression script.R".  The requirements are described in the file "requirements.txt".  Instructions on how to use the program are included as comments in the R file.  After opening the file, please read the instructions carefully before executing the code to ensure that the program functions correctly.
